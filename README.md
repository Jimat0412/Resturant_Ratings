- PowerBI - Interactive dashboards for tracking restaurant trends, demand-supply gaps, and location analysis.

 ### Data Cleaning

 in the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
 1. data loading and inseption
 2. handling missing value
 3. data cleaning and formatting 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data before making business decisions. Below is a breakdown of key insights from the datasets.

1.	Understanding Consumer Preferences 

2.	Analyzing Restaurant Ratings

3.	Consumer Demographics & Behavior

4.	Location-Based Analysis

   
### Data Analysis

The data analysis focused on consumer preferences, restaurant ratings, and market demand-supply gaps to identify business opportunities in the restaurant industry.


### Results

- Mexican cuisine is the most preferred, but Coffee Shops, Latin American, and Hot Dogs have high demand with very few restaurants‚Äîa major market gap.

- High-rated restaurants don‚Äôt always match demand‚Äîgood service and food quality are key factors for success.

- Young consumers (21-25, students, medium budget) dominate the market, preferring affordable, fast-casual dining.

- Best locations for investment: University areas, business districts, and high-foot-traffic zones with low competition.

  
### Summary

This analysis identifies profitable restaurant investment opportunities by studying consumer preferences, restaurant ratings, and market demand-supply gaps.

## Recommendation 
Based on the analysis We recommend the following actions:
- Invest in High-Demand, Low-Supply Cuisines ‚Äì Coffee Shops, Latin American, and Hot Dogs have high demand but few restaurants, making them great opportunities.
- Target Young, Budget-Conscious Consumers ‚Äì Most customers are 21-25 years old, students, and prefer affordable, fast-casual dining.
- Improve Service & Food Quality ‚Äì High ratings come from consistent food and good service, not just popular cuisine.
- Expand to Underserved Locations ‚Äì Focus on university areas, business districts, and high-foot-traffic zones with low competition.

### Limitations
- Geographic Restriction ‚Äì The data is limited to Mexico, so insights may not apply globally.
- Demographic Bias ‚Äì Most consumers are young (21-25), students, and single, which may not represent all dining habits.
- Missing & Incomplete Data ‚Äì Some restaurant details, customer demographics, and ratings were incomplete or inconsistent, affecting accuracy.
- Lack of Financial Data ‚Äì No information on restaurant revenue, costs, or profitability, limiting financial projections.
